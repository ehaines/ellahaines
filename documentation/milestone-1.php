		<h1>Purpose</h1>
		<p>I would like this site to help establish me as a web developer by showcasing my skills.</p>
		<h1>Audience</h1>
		<p>
			My intended audience for this site consists of potential employers and clients.
		</p>
		<h1>Goal</h1>
		<p>
			My goal for this site is for it to serve as something like a portfolio for my work. I'd like to showcase
			my skills in PHP, HTML, JavaScript, Java and Python. I want to use it to achieve full-time employment or
			to attract potential freelance customers.
		</p>
		<p>
			If possible I'd like to include a game I (hopefully) will finish writing in Java soon for my other class.
			I'd also like to do a parallax effect with a background image because I hear that's trendy.
