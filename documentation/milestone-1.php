		<h1>Goal</h1>
		<p>
			My goal for this site is for it to serve as something like a portfolio for my work. I'd like to showcase
			my skills in PHP, HTML, JavaScript, Java and Python.I want to use it to achieve full-time employment or
			to attract potential freelance customers. If possible I'd like to include a game I (hopefully)
			will finish writing in Java soon for my other class.
